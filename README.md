# Countdown

![Workflow result](https://github.com/hedvigoscar/dev-challenge-week-two/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
A simple countdown app. It has a dual-purpose button to start and stop the counter.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I found it especially interesting to work with coroutines to create the ticker powering the
countdown. I've used out-of-the-box ticker solutions from Rx before, and I'm always surprised
at how easy some of these things are to implement yourself using coroutines.

It's also nice to see how easy you can get some state that is saved using `rememberSaveable`,
Compose continues to be a joy to build stuff in, quickly and correctly.
